_Biostatistics_ &#124; _High dimensional data integration_ &#124; _Latent variable modelling_ &#124; _R programming_

#### Post-doctoral researcher at UMC Utrecht
##### Dec. 2018 - now

I am developing and applying statistical and computational methods for probabilistic omics integration. Relevant techniques are multi-outcome multivariate GWAS, sparse omics data integration, global versus local association studies. This work is done within the E-rare MSAOmics project.

#### PhD student at Leiden UMC
##### Dec. 2014 - Dec. 2018

I am working on statistical analysis of several (high dimensional) omics datasets. An important aim here is to quantify relationships between variables in these omics datasets, and to translate these (together with experts) to biological findings. My research is about defining and refining data integration methods to understand the merits of these models, and to extend them to incorporate tricky characteristics of omics data. This work is done within the FP7 project MIMOmics.

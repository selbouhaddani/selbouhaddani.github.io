### OmicsPLS
OmicsPLS is designed for integrating two high dimensional datasets, visualise relationships between the features and inspect groupings across subjects. The OmicsPLS package can be applied in many fields, in particular life sciences.

### PO2PLS
Probabilistic O2PLS (PO2PLS) is a reformulation of O2PLS and an extension of Probabilistic PLS, that describes the relation between all predictors and response variables using joint and specific latent variables. The set of predictors and responses are potentially high dimensional, where the number of variables exceed the sample size, and highly correlated, both within and between the sets of variables.

### Current projects
#### Methodology
- Association analysis of high dimensional covariate data with one or multiple correlated outcomes
- Extensions of O2PLS and Probabilistic O2PLS
- An asymptotic inference framework for Probabilistic O2PLS

#### Applications
- Integrating multiple omics data to model and predict MSA
- Integrating RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data in a case-control study
- Associating multiple atherosclerosis markers with genetic SNPs

#### Software
- OmicsPLS R package
- PO2PLS R package


### Old projects
#### Methodology
- The Probabilistic O2PLS framework for diverse omics datasets
- Probabilistic PLS as probabilistic alternative for Partial Least Squares, including asymptotic standard errors
- O2PLS as data integration method in large population studies

#### Applications
- Integration of longitudinal family data on Genetics, Methylation and triglyceride levels
- Statistical integration of Genetic-glycan and Transcriptomic-metabolomic data with Probabilistic O2PLS
- Modeling joint relationships between IgG1 and IgG2 glycomics data with Probabilistic PLS
- Integrating Genetic and Glycomics data with O2PLS
- Integrating Transcriptomics and Metabolomics data with O2PLS

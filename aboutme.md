subtitle: Post-doctoral researcher high dimensional biostatistics
---

My name is Said el Bouhaddani, a post-doc at the UMC Utrecht. My field of interest is in high dimensional biostatistics, working on statistical analysis of several omics datasets. 
An important aim here is to quantify relationships between variables in these omics datasets and to translate these (together with experts) to biological findings. 
My research focuses on the statistical methodology, and is about defining and refining data integration methods to understand the merits of these models and to extend them to incorporate characteristics of omics data.

On this site, you can find projects, presentations and publications related to my work.
